# HomebaseScraper

The end goal of this program is being able to collect information about work hours of employees
from Homebase (possibly including things like tip information too which would have to be entered manually)
and email them to an accountant for tax purposes. This is normally easy to do by utilizing the
Homebase API but it requires an additional monthly payment to Homebase which can be a large expense
for small restaurant owners.
